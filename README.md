# üíª Application Used
  [SIMULINK](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html#:~:text=Simulink%20is%20a%20block%20diagram,and%20deploy%20without%20writing%20code.) a MATLAB-based graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems. Its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries. It is a popular tool for both educational and professional purposes.

  [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.
